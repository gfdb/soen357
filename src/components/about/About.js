                        We are a group of Bachelors students and enthusiasts in Concordia University who wants to contribute to the
                        community and improve people's lives.
                        We are based in Montreal, Quebec.
                        We were inspired to develop RentAll after seeing and talking to people who are facing difficult financial situations and
                        people who want to reduce waste. We developed this
                        application as part of the SOEN 357 final project.
