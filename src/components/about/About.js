                        We a group of Bachelors students and enthusiasts in Concordia University who wants to conteibute to the
                        community and improve people's lives.
                        We are based in Montreal, Quebec.
                        We were inspired to develop RentAll after seeing and talking to people who are facing difficult financial situation and
                        people who wants to reduce waste. We developed this
                        application as part of the SOEN 357 final project.
