# Description
This application is a prototype of a web app UI to be used for the RentAll application. RentAll will be an application where users can be the renters or the rentees. Users can rent out their unused items whether it be an appliance, textbook, bicycle, car, or anything else they aren't using. Renters can rent items they want for various amounts of time for the fee listed by the owner of the item.

# How To Run:

1. Firstly, you will need to install npm and nodejs (a javascript package manager and a javascript runtime environment) if you do not already have it installed. Since we are using the latest verison React, we suggest that you use a "new" npm/node version. The prototype was tested using npm version 8.1.2 and node version v16.13.2 so please install or update to those versions if you have any trouble.
Download node/npm here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Clone the soen357 repository.
3. Open a terminal window and change the working directory to soen357 (the directory you cloned in step 2).
4. Type `npm install` , this will install the packages needed to run the application.
5. Type `npm start` to start running the app.
6. The webapp should open automatically in your default browser. If not, open a browser and type "localhost:3000" in the url bar.
